#Detecting Fortideceptor
FortiDeceptor_Detection

Detecting FortiDeceptor decoys or any advanced deception technology in a network is challenging because these solutions are explicitly designed to blend in with legitimate systems. However, there are certain techniques attackers and red teamers may use to identify decoys, which can also help defenders validate their deployment.

1. Network-Based Detection Techniques
Latency Analysis: Deception systems often have higher response times due to their monitoring layer. Measuring network latency for specific services (like SMB, RDP) can sometimes reveal decoys.

Unusual Open Ports: FortiDeceptor may configure decoys with standard and non-standard ports. Scanning for unusual combinations using Nmap or Masscan might reveal decoys.

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sS -p- -T4 <target-ip>
Banner Grabbing: Check service banners for inconsistencies or default configurations.

bash
Copy
Edit
nc <target-ip> <port>
ARP and MAC Address Anomalies: Decoys may have MAC addresses that don't match typical vendor ranges. Use arp-scan:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo arp-scan --localnet
2. System-Based Detection
Service Enumeration: Decoys often lack depth in service configurations. For example, an RDP decoy might allow connections but lack real user data.

Check for Default Credentials: Some decoys use easy-to-guess credentials.
Examine File Systems: Decoys might have minimal file structures or dummy files.
System Uptime: Newly deployed decoys often have low uptime. You can check this using:

bash
Copy
Edit
net stats workstation
Virtualization Artifacts: Decoys often run in virtual environments. Look for:

Virtual NICs.
Specific drivers or processes related to virtualization.
Using PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object Manufacturer, Model
3. Behavioral Analysis
Noisy Interactions: FortiDeceptor decoys typically log all activity. If simple actions (e.g., port scans) result in immediate network alerts or blocks, it could indicate decoys are present.

Outbound Traffic: Monitor decoy interactions for unusual outbound connections to FortiDeceptor management consoles or SIEM solutions.

bash
Copy
Edit
tcpdump -i any host <decoy-ip>
4. FortiDeceptor-Specific Clues
While FortiDeceptor tries to avoid leaving signatures, some clues might help:

Agent-Based Footprints: Check for processes or services tied to Fortinet products.
Decoy Breadth: FortiDeceptor often deploys decoys across various layers (network, endpoint, application). A network with too many "too-perfect" systems could suggest decoys.
5. Defensive Tips
Regularly rotate decoys and vary their configurations.
Use threat intelligence to monitor for known decoy-detection tools.
Employ deception alongside active defenses like EDR and NDR for layered security.
